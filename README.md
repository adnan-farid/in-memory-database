# Data Processing and Storage

## How to Run Code
This program is written in C++17. Follow these steps to compile and run the `main.cpp` file in your project using CLion or any other IDE:

1. Create a new project in CLion (or any other IDE) or open an existing one.
2. Upload `main.cpp` in the project directory.
4. Ensure that the necessary build configurations are set for C++17.
5. Use the build and run options in your IDE to compile and execute the program.
6. The test cases provided should run automatically when the program is executed.

## Assignment Improvement Suggestions
1. Add delete method to the assignment because its very common in databases.
2. Could modify this assignment in a REST API format. Require the students to run test cases by making HTTP requests to a backend that they wrote, and have the database stored in the backend (this should be given additional time and perhaps be awarded more points).
3. Specify what packages you want to be used for backend/frontend if you implement #2 (axios, express, etc.)
4. One last thing: to make this project a little more realistic, make the database for student names and student ID's (with input validations, for example, student id's must be 8 characters in length and must only contain numbers).
